# TROA PC Controller Mapper context

## Purpose

Build toward TROA PC Controller Mapper, a modern controller mapping app for TROA's community based on Edward's AntiMicroX fork. Implementation of the first Windows preview is authorized.

## Product direction - 2026-10-05

- Working product name: TROA PC Controller Mapper.
- Audience: TROA's community.
- Initial platform: Windows. Preserve architectural room for Linux support later; Linux is not part of initial release acceptance.
- Requested features: a modern interface, MCP access for collaboratively creating and editing profiles, and curated desktop/browser/game/controller profiles delivered through updates.
- Planned distribution: branded installer/portable packages and corresponding source in GitHub Releases, consumed by a future TROA website product/download page. Website work and publishing have not begun.
- Ownership: Edward keeps the personal GitHub repository. Collaborator access stays unchanged at his request; TROA organization admins do not automatically have personal-repository access. TROA can distribute public release artifacts.
- Initial implementation retains C++17/Qt Widgets/SDL2 and modernizes the workspace around the existing mapping controls. Profile management and local MCP are separate layers; a QML migration or Rust remake is deferred.
- Preserve AntiMicroX attribution, existing copyright notices, and applicable GPL obligations in derived releases.

## Repository

- Fork: https://github.com/edwardsong08/troa-pc-controller-mapper
- Upstream: https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox
- Default branch: master
- Initial checkout: dbb6349603e6ee2426d300eee9570e1ed44fb9f5
- Local folder: C:\Users\edwar\Desktop\ACTIVE PROJECTS\TOOLS AND FUN\antimicrox
- Stack: C++17, Qt 6 with Qt 5 fallback, SDL2, CMake.
- License: existing GPL license; preserve upstream notices.

## App installed for inspection

- Official upstream Windows release 3.6.1, downloaded from GitHub Releases.
- Executable: C:\Users\edwar\AppData\Local\Programs\AntiMicroX\bin\antimicrox.exe
- Installer and provenance record: sibling antimicrox-downloads folder.
- Installer SHA256 matched the official GitHub asset digest.
- This is the upstream binary, not a build of the fork.

## Source map

- src/gui/: Qt windows, mapping dialogs, calibration, settings.
- src/inputdaemon.cpp and src/inputdevice.cpp: input processing and device management.
- src/eventhandlers/winsendinputeventhandler.cpp: Windows keyboard/mouse output.
- src/joybuttontypes/ and src/gamecontroller/: mapping behavior and controllers.
- share/gamecontrollerdb_windows.txt: Windows controller database.
- CMakeLists.txt and .github/workflows/: build, packaging, and CI.
- tests/: Qt GUI test sources; CMake currently requests Qt5Test.

## Next action list for discussion

These remain future work unless Edward authorizes the next implementation phase.

1. Collect Edward's feedback on the installed preview and choose which inherited mapping dialogs to modernize next.
2. Connect a compatible MCP client and collaboratively author game-specific and controller-specific profiles.
3. Extend the managed profile schema to triggers, advanced macros, and automatic application switching as needed.
4. Build the TROA website product/download page and publish versioned installer, portable, and corresponding source assets together.
5. Establish the release/update process, including curated catalog changes and Windows signing when available.
6. Finish Linux branding and packaging before treating it as a supported product platform.

## Verification limits

Windows compilation and packaging run in GitHub Actions. No automated, visual, or hardware tests are authorized for this preview. Desktop screenshot automation timed out during upstream installation. Edward requested the actual app rather than opening the source in VS Code.

## Authorized implementation - 2026-10-05

- Edward approved proceeding and explicitly requested no test runs. Compilation/packaging are permitted; runtime behavior must be described as untested.
- Work branch: codex/troa-controller-mapper.
- New code: src/troa/identity.h, profilestore.*, localapi.*, modernshell.*, and mcp_main.cpp.
- Bundled profile catalog: profiles/catalog.json. Personal definitions and history live under the user data directory.
- MCP operations use a same-user Qt local socket and stdio companion; assistant access has a visible off switch.
- Windows preview workflow packages an installer, portable ZIP, corresponding source ZIP, and SHA256 checksums. No ctest or other test commands run.
- Inherited advanced dialogs remain available. MCP schema initially covers standard SDL buttons, D-pad, and sticks, with key chords and mouse actions.
